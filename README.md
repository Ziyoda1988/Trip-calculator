You are planning to make a road trip (for example, from Virginia to Florida) and you would like to know how much money you are going to spend on gas to get there so that you can budget your expense beforehand.

Please create a program that calculates the estimated cost of the gas for the trip based on the input from the user.

The user needs to enter the following information:

1. Estimated distance of the trip in miles.

2. Average MPG of the car that is going to be used for the trip.

3. Current gas price

Based on the information above, the program needs to display to the user the amount of gas that is going to be used in gallons, and the estimated cost of the gas for the trip.

Describe what your program does on the first  line.

Use Scanner class to get the input.

And finally display the both the Amount of gas and Cost of gas to the user at the end.

Example console output is given in the Screenshot.png file.

Write your code in Main.java file.
